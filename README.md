# How I worked on this project
  My goal was to gain a deeper understanding of some core technology while also exploring real work environments
  
  * I built the http server with vanilla node.js: [Screenshot of server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141239383-89176f2d-bf70-4beb-aee8-3a437da7b24c.png)  
  * I used vanilla css with media queries to make a responsive website: [Example media query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141241172-2804ec08-3e69-4c21-8214-ba136f7fd879.png)
  * I worked with tasks on a github project board: [Screenshot of tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141241031-a6405a66-3755-468b-a2a4-44126d6c9f8b.png)
  * I used development and production branches and pull requests: [Example PR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141242711-78f9830f-e72c-47e6-81e1-1cc625d00d4a.png)

# How to navigate this project
  * The UI is handled with React: [Example code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141388352-8302acf6-ac1f-4012-92cb-56c02dd7613f.png)
  * AJAX is used to send data to server: [Example code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141387627-2e0d0407-96ab-4ad2-b91f-3ed88749948b.png)
  * Form submissions were parsed with the Formidable API: [Example code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141386978-0a79c401-5a1f-4d8e-9cf4-a30083f19a8a.png)
  * The application sends emails with the Nodemailer API: [Example code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47878230/141386194-164f7711-59e2-4326-9eb9-1f0085120328.png)

# Why I built the project this way
  * I plan on being a full-stack developer, so decided to build a custom server with node.js to handled the api as well as to staticly serve the website
  * Not using frameworks in some places allowed me to keep the app lightweight, while also developing a better understanding of the technology
  * I didnt use a state management library like Redux since the app is simple enought where '''useState''' is efficient
# If I had more time I would change this

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
