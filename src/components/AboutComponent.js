				I believe in creating a lifestyle that works FOR YOU, not
				forcing yourself into habits that you hate or won’t serve you. I
				use science to create a customized, evidence based plan.
				Everyone’s plan looks different because everyone’s lifestyle,
				goals, genetics, limitations, hormones, fitness levels, etc are
				different. This is typically done in a 3 step process of 1:
				upregulating your metabolism and building a healthy base, 2:
				cutting body fat at a sustainable rate, and then 3: creating
				balance in the maintenance phase. I use a holistic approach to
				help reach your goals being that health uses 3 pillars. We work
				on your fitness, diet, AND mindset. You need all 3 to be
				successful in reaching your goals.

				My clients’ success is my success and I put my heart and soul
				into all my clients. My passion is to help people beyond their
				time with me and instill them with the habits to keep them
				successful for the rest of their life. There is no point in
				doing a pushy, quick fix program to lose some weight, only to
				have no idea what to do when it’s over, and go back to where you
				were before or rebound even worse. If the program is not
				sustainable you will never ever have the body or life you
				desire. I want to put an end to yo-yo dieting and all-or-nothing
				mentalities. Your health and well being will come before
				ANYTHING else and I do everything with YOUR best interest in
				mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve lost weight, I’ve gained weight, I’ve been unhealthy, I’ve
				been where you are.. and if I haven’t personally experienced
				what you’re going through one of the hundreds of amazing clients
				I have worked with has. No matter where you are in life or how
				far out of reach your goals may seem I guarantee I can get you
				to where you want to be if you follow my plan. You need
				accountability and direction to get there and that’s just a
				piece of what I provide. Stop putting your life, happiness, and
				health on hold and take charge of it today!
